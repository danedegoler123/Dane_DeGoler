		XHTML and CSS are the standards for making a website work. They are essentially what runs everything.
		<p><hr/>
		
	<h3><a name = "Scope">Scope</a></h3>
		<p>
		The scope is what happens between the opening and closing tags. Everything
		that is in the tags applies to an object, and everything outside the tags belong to another object.
		<p><hr/>
		
	<h3><a name = "Head">Head</a></h3>
		<p>
		The head of the site is the keywords for search enginees. The title of the website, browser information, etc. In other words, the head of a site includes information for the browser.
		<p><hr/>
		
	<h3><a name = "Body">Body</a></h3>
		The body of the site is the main source of content which could include paragraphs, images, audio, animations, backgrounds, etc. This is the main section of the website where most of the input is.
		<p>
		<p><hr/>
		
	<h3><a name = "Tags">Tags</a></h3>
		<p>
		Tags are the makeup of the language of XHTML. Every component in a website is contained in a tag. For example, the first tag you create determines what type of document you would like.
		<p><hr/>
	<h3><a name = "Other">Other</a></h3>
		<p>
		The "Strong" tag makes the text in bold. The "em" tag emphasizes the text by italicizing it. To add a horizontal line you do the "hr/" tag and to break a line, you do the "br/" tag. For headers, "h1" is the biggest size available and the smallest size is "h6". These tags will be helpful for organization and showing importantce.
