	<h3><a name = "Scope">Scope</a></h3>

		The scope is what happens between the opening and closing tags. Everything
that is in the tags applies to an object, and everything outside the tags belong to another object.

	<h3><a name = "Head">Head</a></h3>

	<h3><a name = "Tags">Tags</a></h3>
		<p>
		Tags are the makeup of the language of XHTML. Every component in a website is contained in a tag. For example, the first tag you create determines what type of document you would like.

	<h3><a name = "Other">Other</a></h3>
		<p>
		The "Strong" tag makes the text in bold. The "em" tag emphasizes the text by italicizing it. To add a horizontal line you do the "hr/" tag and to break a line, you do the "br/" tag. For headers, "h1" is the biggest size available and the smallest size is "h6". These tags will be helpful for organization and showing importantce.
