				<h1>Childhood</h1>
			</header>
			<p>I was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on October 29, 2001 as a triplet. I have one brother named Steele and a sisster named Elle. We moved to San Diego when we were around 2 years old and have been living here ever since. We went to R. Roger Rowe Middle School and now we are freshmen at Torrey Pines. My brother and I are currently playing football and lacrosse, while my sisster is playing lacrosse.</p>
