User input notes

Since we can’t use spaces, capitalize the next word (firstName) instead of (firstname). Or you can put an underscore between the two words (first_name).

Function calls should end with parenthesis [function_name()]

One of the things that makes Python really simple is the act of taking user input. You take user input by calling the function input () and entering a prompt into the parenthesis.
For example:
variableName = input (“[prompt for user input]”) 

The variableName is equal to the data value received from the input ().

The data we get from input () is string data by default. So, we can use casting.

Casting allows us to have one type of data and make it into another. We do this by wrapping the desired data in a casting statement, which is the type of data that you want to cast the object into, followed by a set of parentheses with the desired data inside.
